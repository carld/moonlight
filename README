Moonlight Creator is an environment dedicated to virtual creation.
It is based on OpenGL and does 3D modelling and rendering for now.

Moonlight is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
It comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
See the LICENSE file for details.

Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Run "moonlight -h" for displaying the options list.

  Interface options are:
    -h                This message
    -v, --verbose     Verbose mode.
    -gamma <gamma>    Specify gamma correction (default is 1)
    -mlrc <file>      Specify ML resource file
    -fs               Run full-screen (default)
    -debug            Don't run full-screen
    -display <server> Run on this X server (default is :0)

  Moonlight is configured for a gamma value of 1.7. If your Xserver
  (or your video driver under Windows) doesn't run with gamma 1.7, you
  can emulate this by specifying the option "-gamma 1.7"

  The "-mlrc" option can be useful for Windows users since they don't have
  the HOME environment variable defined (most of the time).
  See RESOURCE_FILE.

Note for the Windows version users
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Moonlight is currently incapable of running with Windows.
  I'd be very happy if someone proves me wrong though ;-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note for new users: interface philosophy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Moonlight is a full-screen application. You should use at least a
  1024x768 screen resolution or higher. It runs with 8 bits displays,
  but 16 bits or higher are preferable.

  How to use it: the Mode-keys
  Clicking on a 3D window does nothing. You have to tell Moonlight to use
  a mode. A mode defines the type of action you want to do. Use the mouse
  to perform the action. You enter a mode by pressing its associated
  mode-key.

  Example: The Select mode-key is Space. For selecting an object:
    + press Space key,
    + select the object with the mouse,
    + release Space.

    Mode-Key   Action-Type
    ~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~
    o          Orbit camera about the focus point
    p          Walk forward of backward
    z          Zoom/Unzoom (Btn2), Pan (Btn1)
    Space      Select object (or area for raytracing)
    Backspace  Delete object
    h          Hide/Unhide object
    i          Get object information
    d          Duplicate an object
    Alt-d      Instantiate an object
    f          Set hierarchy (Select child and then its father)
    x          Scale selection
    Alt-x      Coord. Scaling (Btn1=X,Btn2=Y,Btn3=Z)
    c          Rotate selection (get a headache)
    Alt-c      Coord. Rotation (Btn1=X,Btn2=Y,Btn3=Z)
    v          Translate selection
    Alt-v      Coord. Translation (Btn1=X,Btn2=Y,Btn3=Z)
    u          Undo (Btn1=undo,Btn3=redo)
    r          Refresh screen (no mouse action)
    C          Orient Z axis of an object (Btn1=-Z,Btn3=+Z)
               (still doesn't work very well...)
    t          Tag vertices (Btn1=toggle,Btn2=select,Btn3=unselect)
               and go to VERtex modelling.
    g          Tag polygon by ray-casting and go to POLygon modelling.
               (Btn1=toggle,Btn2=select,Btn3=unselect)
    a          Edit object material
    ESC        Escape current mode if any.

  Careful: you can work on different modelling components:
           the object (OBJ), the vertex (VTX) or the polygon (POL).

Under X-Window: Moonlight and window-managers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I suggest you to put Alt-F9 as the iconify'ing key in your window manager
  settings. If you're running fvwm or compatible, add to your .fvwmrc,
  .fvwm2rc, .fvwm2rc95, .steprc:

    Key F9 WISFT12 M Iconify

  Since Moonlight is a full screen application, this binding is usefull
  when ML freezes in infinite loop or in a heavy computation.

  About Enlightenment: this window manager seems not to allow fullscreen
  application. To be followed after the next release of this
  great environment (May 28 1998).

  Don't forget that Moonlight removes key auto-repeat on your X server.
  If it is abnormally killed, use:

    xset r

  for setting key auto-repeat again.
