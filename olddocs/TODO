Quick & dirty TODO list for Moonlight-3D

First, Moonlight needs a tutorial. It could be available online and
distributed in a tar.gz file too. Volunteers are needed!

"Little" things
---------------
+ port the dynamic library loading stuff to HPUX
   (src/tools/MLDynamicLibrary.*)
+ antialising in the renderer
+ be able to save a snapshot of the display
+ export both in SART and Panorama formats
+ detach a polygon
+ remove a vertex
+ remove a polygon
+ material preview
+ convert all polygons into quads/triangles
+ reverse a primitive or a polygon
+ be able to zoom *all viewports* so that the current selection (or
  entire scene) fits neatly inside the borders of each viewpoint.  This is
  the same as AC3D's "View | Fit All" command.
  (jeff.garzik@spinne.com)
+ * Textures and image maps :)
  * Multiple cameras
  (jeff.garzik@spinne.com)
+ boolean operations
+ base primitives parameters edition
+ create a parametric surface (or curve) from a simple equation (need to
  parse an expression with flex/bison)

Heavy stuff
-----------
+ more NURBS surface
+ more NURBS curves
+ simple API access. scripting language (java or tcl).
+ generic curve edition engine
+ animation (needs the previous item and many many other things before)
+ extend the OOM (object oriented modelling) module for creating an
  OMT view of the project
+ improve the raytracer: first pass by zbuffering
