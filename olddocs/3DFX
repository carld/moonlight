I've got a 3dfx, currently, and I checked Moonlight and the GLTT demos
with 3dfx. I used the "windowed" rendering, which uses the 3dfx for
rendering and copies the result into an X-Window. I'm using Mesa 2.6
with Linux.

GLTT demos:
demo: Crashes after the bitmapped font demos, alpha-blending demo didn't
work
logo: Works fine

Moonlight:
"windowed" mode: crahes after the introduction screen, paints the empty
wire-frame view, but no menus or dialogs. upper area of the intro-screen
is garbled.
"fullscreen" mode: crahes after intro-screen.

I think, that these are problems with the 3dfx. It's limited to a
640x480 screen, and it works independant from the normal gfx-card.
(i.e.: You can connect one monitor to your normal card, and another to
the 3dfx.)
Mabye it's interesting to check a new VooDoo2, with more memory.
