Moonlight Creator ChangeLog

0.5.3   June 10 1998
  - Added a glut previewer in docs/mlraw (from Daniel Thom
    <psu12149@odin.cc.pdx.edu>)
  - KoalaGui (Interface) is now an MLAppRoot. Koala Modules are just
    nodes. ModelModule is a child node of MLScene (which is an AppRoot)
  - Fixed some template bugs in src/tools
  - Wrote the src/tools/ML*Log* files.
  - Added an emacs-like command line for entering commands. Commands
    and messages logging window. (press right button for it)
  - The "oom" module is back, even if it is quite empty for now.
  - Wrote some information about the kernel in src/kernel/README.
  - Kernel procedures code has been reorganized.
  - Fixed a serious bug in src/tools/MLHashTable.h (could cause an
    "Virtual memory exceeded in `new'" crash)
  - Fixed the --with-gl-prefix bug in configure (<thron@gmx.de>)
  - MLCanvas and MLEngines inherit MLNode now.
  - Removed src/3D/scene/MLVertex.h,MLSVertex.h,MLEdge.h,MLPolygon.h
  - Enabled -g by default for the development release.

0.5.2   May 24 1998
  - Integrated back the 3D formats converter (DXF, etc).
  - Dependency files: .depend for developpement build, .depend-opt for
    an optimized build.

0.5.1   May 21 1998
  - Integrated back the (small) photo module.
  - ML compiles fine with jpeg-v6b
  - Added some pointers highlighting to the interface buttons
  - Added the MLEvent::MOUSE_ENTER and MLEvent::MOUSE_LEAVE events
  - Added Procedures Manager in kernel with undo/redo stuff
  - Replaced "source" by "." in main/Makefile
  - Fixes for windows platform. (unable to do dlopen() with Cygnus tools)
  - Renamed ELEMENT to T in tools/MLDArray.h
  - Included a test for old version of gcc (<2.8.1)
  - Test for supported -mpentium in acinclude.m4
  - Test for dlfcn.h header in configure.in
  - Holidays:-)
  - Use of GLTTBitmapFont instead of GLTTPixmapFont in
    3D/kmodel/gdialogs/MLDSelectTTFont.C

0.5.0   May 3 1998
  - A first version of the Sunny Architecture is here. Note that Moonlight
    doesn't use it yet! This is only the first step towards this new
    architecture. The 3D kernel will use this new architecture step by step,
    in future releases. (this is really a long work...)
  - The whole compilation process has been revised. Moonlight executable
    is now broken in shared libraries. Plug-ins and modules are
    shared libraries. Source structure has been updated too.
  - libtool is now used for compiling, linking and installing libraries and
    plug-ins.
  - Internal changes: OString becomes MLString, MLFileEntry should be
    used instead of ListFiles, MLDArray (template) replaces DArray (define).
    New classes: MLSocket*, MLHashTable, MLEnumeration, MLDynamicLibrary.
    (BTW, MLDynamicLibrary should be updated for HP-UX targets).
  - You need to install GLTT on your system now. GLTT is no more included
    into Moonlight source distribution.
  - About scripting languages: a Tcl plug-in is written. Not used for now.
  - 3 freeware true type fonts are now included and installed.

0.4.3   April 8 1998
  This a minor release. I am working on the new architecture and the
  code of next major release will be slightly different. But as far as
  people send me new features for the current version, i maintain it.
  - Removed tools/poptions.[Ch] (unused)
  - Fixed some small bugs in the MD2 exporters.
  - Added the RIB exporter (Dave Whittington <whitting@motispd.com>).
  - Removed some duplicated files in src/scene
  - Updated the FAQ.
  - New CODING, PORTED and 3DFX information files [don't dream, 3Dfx cards
    apparently don't have enough OpenGL features to run Moonlight:(]
  - Development is now made with glibc and libpthread. (was: libc5 and
    libpthreads)
  - Fixed a fp bug under FreeBSD.

0.4.2   March 11 1998
  - Some fixes for Debian and RedHat build.
  - Solaris port by Clint Moore <cmoore@shn.net>
  - changed name & class hints (Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@efis.ucr.ac.cr>)
  - Moonlight starts up on a specific module, depending on the base
     filename. See src/main/ml.C. (shortcut for kbuilder, etc.)
  - added True Type Fonts handling. (Plain Text primitive)
  - True Type Font selection dialog.
  - !Warning! ~/.mlrc has been renamed into ~/.moonlightrc
  - changed the resource file format. It looks like an std .ini file now.
    (see RESOURCE_FILE)
  - HPCR device port by Jacques LEROY <jle@star.be>. He recommends use
    of gamma 2.5 on this device.
  - updated "make install". it properly installs the binary, the
    moonlightrc file and creates a default database.
  - added some information files.
  - Quake II MD2 format importer/exporter by Adam Mayer <phooky@gyral.com>
  - and just for fun: the GPL license scrolling text at the beginning:-)
