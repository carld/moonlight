Resource File information for Moonlight Creator
-----------------------------------------------

!Warning! ~/.mlrc has been renamed into ~/.moonlightrc since 0.4.2

Introduction
============

The resource file of Moonlight allows you to configure your environment.
Moonlight needs one. When Moonlight starts, it tries to read the following
resource files (in this order):

  <install_prefix_dir>/etc/moonlightrc
  ~/.moonlightrc
  $MOONLIGHT_RC_FILE (set by "export MOONLIGHT_RC_FILE=...")
  the file you optionaly specify by the -mlrc command line option

The installation of Moonlight creates the
<instal_prefix_dir>/etc/moonlightrc file and a default database
in <install_prefix_dir>/share/moonlight/database

Note that command line options will always override the parameters set
into your resource file(s).

Format
======

The resource file format for Moonlight has changed since version 0.4.2.
You now have the following sections:
  [Moonlight]    : dedicated to general environment configuration
  [Moonlight 3D] : for the 3D module

Each section has variables:

  variable=value

You can use environment variables:

  variable=$HOME/graphics

You can reuse variables with '%':

  var1=foo
  var2=%var1;bar

Current types are:
  bool : 0 (for false) or 1 (for true)
  real : a real number
  path : a path list. For example: /usr/moonlight:/home/user/ml:.
         or ~/moonlight:~peter/ml/:/usr
         You can use either ':' or ';' as path separator.
         For Windows users: use slash "/" or backslash "\" as you want.
         If you don't specify the drive, C: is used. Use Cygnus-Win32
         convention for drives naming. (for example "//D/windows" refers
         to "D:\windows")

Line beginning with "#" are considered as comments.
