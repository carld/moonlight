DEVELOPERS information for Moonlight Creator
--------------------------------------------

Use "make" for building an optimized-version.

Use "make MOONLIGHT_DEV=yes" for building a developer's version. (this
binary is not running full-screen and you can exit it by pressing
<ctrl><alt><key_pad_insert>)

You can also use an environment variable:

  export MOONLIGHT_DEV=yes
  make

and when compiling an optimized version:

  make MOONLIGHT_DEV=""

If you really want to add a "-g" flag, use "make debug=yes". You can
also set the MOONLIGHT_DEBUG environment variable to "yes".

"make clean" removes obj/$target_os/{dev|opt}/*.o
"make realclean" removes obj/
"make distclean" removes obj/ and Makeconfig, config.cache, etc.

Edit the src/modules file for enabling modules.

If you want to set up a new module, read the "tmpl" module sources.
Use the "src/tmpl/replace_tmpl_names" for creating a new source
tree for the tmpl tree.

The objects files, the libraries and the final binaries are recorded
in $target_os/$dev_opt/ directories.

  $target_os is your target OS.
  $dev_opt is "dev" for a developer's version,
              "opt" for a final optimized version.

If you want to link from a directory, use the shortcut "make _ml"

Dialogs are created with the "KBuilder" module. They read/write a .dlg
file and generate a .h and a .C file. See source code...
If you want to start directly with the kbuilder module, make a link:
  ln -s moonlight kbuilder
and run "kbuilder".
