Database information for Moonlight 3D
-------------------------------------

Moonlight stores its files in directories called "databases".
A database is a directory entry that contains a ML database hierarchy
(geometries, scenes, materials, etc.)

If you want to save your scenes you need at least one database to save
them into.

You can download a sample existing scene or using the default
database of the distribution.

If you want to create a new one (say, in /usr/local/database)

  cd /usr/local
  mkdir database
  cd database
  mkdir GEOMETRIES HIERARCHIES IMAGES MATERIALS PROJECTS SCENES

Then you have to maintain the databases list in your Resource File.
See RESOURCE_FILE.
