This is Moonlight 3D root. You can see Moonlight-3D as a plug-in
of MLKernel.

        scene/      The 3D kernel itself

        kmodel/     The GUI based on the Koala Interface

Here's how it works: the GUI (it can be any GUI, the default implemented
one is the Koala one) is created by the main executable.
This GUI resides into libmoon_koagagui.

Then this GUI creates new MLAppRoot's by loading kmodel libs as
MLKernelModule's. Each kmodel creates a MLScene which is a MLAppRoot, and
returns it.

A command-line tool could only start a scene module and work with it
without starting any interface.

That's all!
