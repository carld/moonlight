This is the graphics part of Moonlight Creator.

In this directory reside the main portable classes for creating windows,
handling events, etc.

Subdirectories are:

  fonts/           The standard bitmap fonts.

  X11/             The X11 wrapper.

  Win/             The Windows wrapper.

If you want to port Moonlight interface to another windowing system
(BeOS, Rhapsody, OS/2, Amiga, ...) you have to create a subdirectory
here, and write a correct wrapper to your windowing system.
