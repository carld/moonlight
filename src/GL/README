Install here the gl.h and glu.h header files that come with Windows OpenGL.

Rename gl.h in wingl.h

Rename glu.h in winglu.h

Edit winglu.h so that it includes "GL/wingl.h" instead of "GL/gl.h"

These files are required only for Cygnus-Win32 target.
Note that you'll need to make some little changes in these files so
that they compile fine with Cygnus-Win32 tools.
